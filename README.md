# civil-confinement-react

A React/Redux app that displays civilly committed prisoners in New York. When users filter the data, the prisoner display and application text dynamically adjusts.

The interactive is available at <a href="http://data.lohud.com/investigations/civil-commitment/">http://data.lohud.com/investigations/civil-commitment/</a> and accompanied an <a href="http://www.lohud.com/story/news/investigations/2017/05/31/civil-commitment-sex-offenders/325390001/">investigation</a> into New York's civil commitment law.
